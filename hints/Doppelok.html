        I have no idea how to start solving this mission

    <div class="answer">
        First of all, read some material about "list.pop()" and "list.append()" methods <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#sequence-types-list-tuple-range" target="_blank">посиланням</a>.

    <div class="answer">
        So, "list.pop()" method removes the element at the specified position, witch you specify in brackets "()". If you enter in your python console "a = [1, 2, 3]" and then use "a.pop(1)", you will get "[1, 3]".

        I have gone halfway through. Need help!
    </div>
    <div class="answer">
        Use "list.append()" method to add an element at the end of the list. So, if you enter in your python console "a.append(2)", you will get "[1, 3, 2]".

        One last question. How my final solution will look like?
    </div>
    <div class="answer">
        <p>Your  code should look like this. And don't forget to check is list empty. An empty list or list with only one element should stay the same.</p>
        <pre class="brush: python">
def replace_first(items: list) -> Iterable:
    if items:
        items.append(items.pop(0))  # The items.pop(0) method stores the value it cut
                                    # that is, the first one from the list, so we can immediately insert it into the list
    return items
        </pre>
